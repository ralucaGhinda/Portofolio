    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>Hi there! I am Raluca, pleased to meet you and welcome to my portofolio website. I am a former tennis coach who decided to embrace a new career. Even though I have been playing tennis since I'm 7 years old, my coaching career had been going on for more than 10 years when I decided that I want a career change due to falling in love with programming.
        <br>
        I have been coding for more than a year now and I must admit, it's becoming even more fun the more I do it. Who wouldn't want a career in something that brings one so much joy, aren't I right?
        <br>
        In my free time I read a lot, do a lot of sports and physical activities (wouldn't want to give that up) and also just got into cooking, but I love traveling the most. My favorite reading genre is personal development, scientific papers, thrillers and newly discovered, history.
        <br>
        Fun fact! I've been programming for .... seconds!</p>
